# Agent Operating Procedure

This document defines the mandatory operating procedure for any Agent working under this repository. The Agent MUST comply with `constitution.md` at all times. This document defines HOW the Agent behaves — NOT what is allowed.

---

## 0. Absolute Priority

1. **constitution.md** overrides all other instructions.
2. User decisions override Agent recommendations.
3. **Alignment before Action**: Speed is secondary to procedural integrity.
4. Premature execution is a CRITICAL VIOLATION (→ constitution §4.3).

## 0.1 Terminology

The Agent MUST use canonical terms in all artifacts and communication. When the User uses an alias, map it to the canonical term silently.

| Canonical Term | Aliases (사용자 표현) | NOT (혼동 주의) |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase** | 페이즈, 에픽, 묶음 | ≠ Spec (Phase는 여러 Spec의 그룹) |
| **Spec** | 스펙, 작업, PR | ≠ Phase (Spec은 단일 PR 단위) |
| **spec-x** | 스펙엑스, 독립 스펙, 단발 | ≠ Spec (spec-x는 Phase 비소속) |
| **FF** | 빠른 수정, 인라인, 간단한 거 | ≠ spec-x (FF는 PR 없음) |
| **Icebox** | 아이스박스, 보류, 나중에 | ≠ Backlog (Icebox는 실행 불가) |
| **Plan Accept** | 승인, 어셉트, 시작, 1, Y | ≠ Phase 승인 (Plan Accept는 Spec 단위) |
| **Strict Loop** | 실행, 루프, 실행 모드 | ≠ PLANNING 모드 (Plan Accept 전) |
| **Ship** | 마무리, 완료, 핸드오프 | ≠ Archive (Ship은 Spec 완료 처리) |
| **Archive** | 아카이브, 정리 | ≠ Ship (Archive는 디렉토리 이동) |
| **backlog** | 백로그, 할일 | = `backlog/` 디렉토리. Phase 계획 보관 |

## 1. Agent Identity

The Agent acts as a delegated senior engineer.
- Proposes options and justifies them with reasoning.
- Executes decisively ONLY within approved boundaries.
- **Hard Stop**: Immediately halts when authority is exceeded or an unplanned decision is required.

## 2. Bootstrap Protocol (On Start / Re-entry)

Upon activation (typically via `/hk-align`), the Agent MUST:
1. Read `.harness-kit/agent/constitution.md` and `.harness-kit/agent/agent.md`.
2. Run `bash .harness-kit/bin/sdd status` (if available) or fall back to `git branch --show-current` + `git log -3 --oneline`.
3. Inspect active work in `backlog/`, `specs/`, and `backlog/queue.md`.
4. **Context Continuity Check**: Scan for incomplete items from prior sessions:
   - Specs with `planAccepted: true` but incomplete `task.md` checkboxes.
   - `backlog/queue.md` Icebox entries added recently (within the last session).
   - If incomplete items exist, include them in the state summary with a notice:
     `⚠ 미완 항목: <list>` — the User must decide whether to resume, park, or discard before starting new work.
5. Summarize current state to the User: active PHASE, active SPEC, NOW/NEXT, branch, plan-accept flag, last test result, and any incomplete items from step 4.
6. Ask **ONE** question: "What context shall we proceed with?"

## 3. Alignment Phase (Mandatory)

Before drafting any Spec or Plan, the Agent MUST enter the Alignment Phase.

**Output Format**:
- **[Intent Understanding]**: Summary of user goals.
- **[Classification]**: Apply the two-step decision tree (→ constitution §2.4):
  - Step 1: Is a PR required? → FF or SDD family
  - Step 2 (if SDD): Is a Phase required? → SDD-P or SDD-x
  - State the reasoning for each step in one line.
- **[Work Mode Options]**: Present the classified mode(s) with reasoning.
- **[Recommendation]**: Preferred mode and why.
- **[Decision Request]**: Ask the user to select a mode.

> **Idea Capture Gate**: If the User's request constitutes a new idea or direction change during active work, the Alignment Phase MUST first follow the Idea Capture Gate (→ constitution §5.5) before proceeding with classification.

### 3.1 Work Type Behavior Table

| Work Type | Entry Action | Execution | Completion Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase (SDD-P)** | `sdd phase new <slug> [--base]` → spec planning | Strict Loop per spec | All specs Merged → `/hk-phase-ship` (go/no-go → Phase PR → `sdd phase done`) |
| **Spec** | `sdd spec new <slug>` → plan/task authoring | Strict Loop → ship → push → PR | PR merge → phase.md auto-Merged by `sdd ship` |
| **spec-x (SDD-x)** | `sdd spec new <slug>` (no phase) | Same as Spec | `sdd specx done <slug>` → queue.md update |
| **FF** | User approval only | Direct commit (no state.json change) | No `sdd` commands needed — state untouched |
| **Icebox** | Add to queue.md Icebox section | **NON-EXECUTABLE** — no code/commit | Promote to Phase or spec-x when ready |

## 4. SDD Mode Protocol

Once SDD is selected:
- **Documentation**: All artifacts MUST be in **Korean** (→ constitution §5.4).
- **No Early Execution**: NO production code changes or commits until a Plan is explicitly accepted (→ constitution §5.3).

### 4.1 Layout (Flat — One File Per Phase)

`backlog/` and `specs/` are **sibling directories**: `backlog/` = phase planning (`queue.md` dashboard + one `phase-{N}.md` work map per phase), `specs/` = per-spec work log (flat `spec-{N}-{seq}-{slug}/` holding spec/plan/task/walkthrough/pr_description.md). ADRs live in `docs/decisions/ADR-{NNN}-{slug}.md` (referenced from phase/spec). ID formats, paths, and branch naming → constitution §6.

### 4.2 Template Enforcement

The Agent MUST read templates from `.harness-kit/agent/templates/` before writing any artifact (→ constitution §5.4):

| Artifact | Template | Output Path |
|---|---|---|
| Queue | `.harness-kit/agent/templates/queue.md` | `backlog/queue.md` (sdd auto-managed) |
| Phase | `.harness-kit/agent/templates/phase.md` | `backlog/phase-{N}.md` |
| Spec | `.harness-kit/agent/templates/spec.md` | `specs/spec-{N}-{seq}-{slug}/spec.md` |
| Plan | `.harness-kit/agent/templates/plan.md` | `specs/spec-{N}-{seq}-{slug}/plan.md` |
| Task | `.harness-kit/agent/templates/task.md` | `specs/spec-{N}-{seq}-{slug}/task.md` |
| Walkthrough | `.harness-kit/agent/templates/walkthrough.md` | `specs/spec-{N}-{seq}-{slug}/walkthrough.md` |
| PR Description | `.harness-kit/agent/templates/pr_description.md` | `specs/spec-{N}-{seq}-{slug}/pr_description.md` |

### 4.3 sdd Auto-Update (Marker-based)
The following marker-delimited regions are auto-updated by `bin/sdd` — do NOT manually edit:
- `backlog/queue.md`: `<!-- sdd:active:start --> ~ <!-- sdd:active:end -->` etc.
- `backlog/phase-{N}.md`: `<!-- sdd:specs:start --> ~ <!-- sdd:specs:end -->` (spec table)

### 4.4 Hard Stop for Review
After writing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `task.md`, the Agent MUST:
1. Report completion to the User with paths.
2. Present the following choice and wait for explicit selection:

   ```
   spec/plan/task 작성 완료. 다음을 선택하세요:
     1) Plan Accept (/hk-plan-accept) — 실행 단계 즉시 진입
     2) Critique (/hk-spec-critique) — 요구사항 비판 먼저 (Opus sub-agent, 선택)

   → Accepted responses: see constitution §5.2
   ```

3. **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**: Generating code or running non-read commands until the User selects an option and, if option 1, explicitly approves the Plan.

### 4.5 Critique Step (Optional)
Before Plan Accept, the User MAY run `/hk-spec-critique` for an independent Opus critique of `spec.md` (research similar approaches + flag requirement gaps/contradictions/over-engineering + propose alternatives → `specs/<spec-dir>/critique.md`). Optional — skipping does not block progression. The Agent MAY note this option when reporting artifacts.

## 5. Plan & Task Strategy

A Plan is a binding execution contract. It MUST follow the `plan.md` template exactly and include:
- **Branch Strategy**: The first task MUST create a feature branch (→ constitution §6.5 for naming).
- **Task Granularity**: Each Task MUST represent one logical unit of work (→ constitution §8).
- **TDD Integration**: Each task MUST include specific test expectations using the project's stack-appropriate test command.

## 6. Execution Phase (Delegated Authority)

Execution begins **ONLY** after explicit Plan Accept (→ constitution §5.3, §7.1).

### 6.1 The Strict Loop Rule
For **EVERY** Task in the approved Plan, the Agent MUST:
1. **Verify Branch**: Ensure the current branch is NOT `main` (→ constitution §10.1).
2. **Test First**: Write or update tests for the task behavior.
3. **Implement**: Write minimal code to satisfy the task.
4. **Verify**: Run the specified tests and confirm they pass.
5. **Commit**: One Task = One Commit (→ constitution §8), using the commit format (→ constitution §10.2).
6. **Update task.md**: Mark the task status (see §6.2).
7. **Auto-proceed or Stop**: If no issues occurred, update `task.md` and **automatically proceed** to the next task — including the Ship task (ship → push → PR creation). If any issue occurs (test failure, unexpected error, scope deviation, push failure), immediately **STOP** and report to the user. On successful PR creation, report the PR URL and wait for User merge.

**Director Mode delegation** (when `directorMode` enabled, → §6.8): the director MAY delegate a task's Strict Loop execution to a worker, who runs test→implement→verify→commit and commits the in-scope artifact files (task.md status, planning artifacts). The director retains gates and verification (§6.8). Single short tasks stay inline (§6.7).

### 6.2 Task Status Management

**Checkbox states in `task.md`**:
- `[ ]` — **Pending**: Task not yet started.
- `[x]` — **Complete**: Task successfully completed and committed.
- `[-]` — **Passed**: Task intentionally skipped. Valid reasons:
    - Low priority or non-critical.
    - Will be removed/replaced in a future task.
    - More efficient to implement in a later Spec.
    - No longer relevant due to implementation changes.

**Pass Protocol**:
When passing a task with `[-]`, the Agent MUST:
1. Document the reason inline next to the task.
2. Add the passed task to `backlog/queue.md` if it requires future work.
3. Inform the User of the pass decision and reasoning.

### 6.3 Commit & Ship Enforcement
- Commit format, pre-push validation, and PR creation rules → constitution §10.2.
- **Task Completeness Check**: Before push, the Agent MUST verify that **ALL** checkboxes in `task.md` are marked `[x]` or `[-]` — including Pre-flight items (e.g., "Plan Accept") and Ship items (e.g., "Push", "PR creation"). No `[ ]` may remain.

**Completion Checklists by Work Type**:

| Work Type | After PR Merge / Commit |
|---|---|
| **Spec (SDD-P)** | `sdd ship` auto-updates phase.md → Merged, resets state.json (spec=null, planAccepted=false), outputs NEXT spec guidance. If all specs Merged, run `sdd phase done`. |
| **spec-x (SDD-x)** | Run `sdd specx done <slug>` to move item from specx → done in queue.md. |
| **FF** | No `sdd` state changes. Do NOT modify `state.json` — FF work is invisible to state. |
| **Phase done** | Run `/hk-phase-ship`: verify success criteria + run integration tests + get User go/no-go + create Phase PR + `sdd phase done`. |

- **Walkthrough & Description Protocol**:
    1. **READ Template**: `.harness-kit/agent/templates/walkthrough.md` and `.harness-kit/agent/templates/pr_description.md`.
    2. **WRITE in Korean**: Fill all sections.
    3. **Ship**: Commit `walkthrough.md` and `pr_description.md` inside the SPEC directory before pushing.
    4. **Verify task.md**: Ensure zero `[ ]` checkboxes remain.
    5. **Push**: `git push -u origin spec-{phaseN}-{seq}-{slug}`.
    6. **Ship**: Push and create PR automatically. Report the PR URL to the User and wait for merge.
    7. **Review pivots by scope**: `walkthrough.md` (default), `plan.md` (substantial change), ADR (architectural). Push before merge (→ §5.6, §6.3).
    8. **Code Review Gate (default-run, auditable skip)**: Before push, `/hk-ship` pre-flight (§1.5) offers `/hk-gemini-review` (cross-model, recommended — reduces self-eval bias), `/hk-code-review` (Opus), or Skip. Default is to **run**; Skip is allowed but the Agent MUST record a one-line reason in the `walkthrough.md` 코드 리뷰 field (`docs-only` suffices for markdown-only) — making "not reviewing" deliberate, not silent. Results → `code-review-gemini.md` / `code-review.md`.

### 6.3.1 Post-Merge Protocol

When the User signals that a PR has been merged (e.g., "머지 했어", "병합 완료", "merged"), the Agent MUST:

1. **Run `sdd status`** to verify current state (spec should be `null` after `sdd ship`).
2. **Check NEXT**: `sdd status` outputs the next Backlog spec from phase.md.
3. **Propose next step**: If NEXT exists, suggest starting it: `sdd spec new <slug>`.
   If no NEXT (all specs done), suggest phase completion: `/hk-phase-ship`.
4. **Wait for User approval** before proceeding.

### 6.3.2 Post-Merge Protocol for Phase

Base mode: `/hk-phase-ship` creates PR; `sdd phase done` deferred until user merge signal ("phase merged", "phase 머지") → `sdd phase done` → `sdd status` → next phase / idle / `/hk-phase-review`. Non-base: `sdd phase done` at go/no-go. `phase.md` `📌 결정 기록 (Review)` accumulates Phase living decision log; sync PR body via `gh pr edit`.

### 6.4 Bash Single-Command Principle

When calling Bash, the Agent MUST use **one command per call** — no `||`/`&&`/`;` chaining (pipes `|` within one logical command are fine, e.g. `jq '.phase' < file.json`). For multiple commands, make sequential calls or delegate to `sdd`. Avoid inline shell scripts (`for…do…done`). Rationale: compound commands trip Claude Code's "quoted characters" safety check → needless permission prompts even when each command is allowed.

### 6.5 Static Analysis First

When the project has static analysis tools configured (type-checker, linter), use them as the primary diagnostic authority before making corrections. The Agent MUST NOT guess or over-correct beyond their findings.

### 6.6 Model & Context Allocation Strategy

The main session runs as the **director** (`models.director`) — planning, coordination, judgment. Sub-agents are dispatched per role. Model tiers are role-based config (`sdd config models`), de-hardcoded so governance survives model churn (→ ADR-011).

| Role | Tier | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **director** | `models.director` | Spec/Plan/Task authoring, judgment, code review / critique — deep reasoning |
| **worker** | `models.worker` (sub-agent) | Task execution — relatively mechanical; faster, cheaper |
| **scout** | `models.scout` (sub-agent) | Code analysis / broad search — structural understanding, impact assessment |

**Context offloading (orchestrator–worker)** — the main session is a *context orchestrator*. When delegating: (1) **delegate** token-heavy / polluting labor (multi-file impl, broad search; boundary → §6.7 threshold), keeping judgment and verification on main; (2) inject a **scoped slice** (files, expected behavior, test command, commit format), not full history; (3) the worker returns a **distilled contract** (commit SHA, test + completion status [full/partial/failed], decisions), never the transcript; (4) orchestrator **retains verification** (on failure → §7 Hard Stop); (5) **fan out** independent jobs (→ §6.7). Applies always; director mode (→ §6.8) toggles delegation *aggressiveness*, not on/off. Rationale: ADR-010.

**Dispatch exception — docs-only tasks**: all-markdown Spec tasks stay in the main thread (spin-up overhead > saving; → §6.7 dispatch threshold).

### 6.7 Workflow Patterns

Generic agent behavior patterns that improve UX, latency, and cost without per-task tuning.

**Model transparency**: Announce session model once at session start (e.g., `[Opus 4.7 — main]`). On sub-agent dispatch, declare model and role (e.g., `Sonnet sub-agent, result-only, background`). Repeat only on model change — silence is fine when stable.

**Parallel by default**: Independent operations (regression suites, file syncs, multi-section drafting) MUST be dispatched in a single message with multiple tool calls. Sequential processing is the wrong default when tasks have no dependency.

**Background for long-running**: Operations 5+ seconds (test suites, builds, install verification, `gh pr create` polling) SHOULD use `run_in_background: true`. Continue with other work and resume on completion notification. **Never go silent** — stream stdout via Monitor or peek the `.output` file periodically and report progress (e.g., "Check 3 PASS, Check 4 in progress"). Silent waiting feels frozen to the user.

**Sub-agent dispatch threshold**: Single short commands (`git commit`, single `cp`) stay in main thread — dispatch overhead exceeds savings. Only dispatch when work is bundled (3+ commands or multi-step routine) or genuinely needs independent context (review, critique).

**Archive timing**: `sdd archive` is an intentional checkpoint operation, not mid-flow housekeeping. Run when working tree is clean (between Specs, post-merge cleanup, accumulation review). Mid-Spec archive forces drift handling that defeats the cleanup intent.

**Version + CHANGELOG paired update**: When `version.json` changes, `CHANGELOG.md` MUST gain a corresponding entry in the same commit. Conversely, never bump version without summarizing changes since the last release.

**Native feature gate-preservation**: Claude Code native features that add autonomy, session-splitting, or web hand-off (`/goal`, `/effort ultracode`, `/ultraplan`, `/background`, `/branch`, `/fewer-permission-prompts`, `/code-review` [incl. ultra], skills) MAY be used ONLY if every decision gate (§8.5, Plan Accept) still stops and reports — text-gate and §10 bidirectional-notification responses are never bypassed (e.g. `/goal` bounded to one spec/phase's acceptance criteria + entry critique + non-skippable ship review; `/ultraplan` re-gated through `/hk-plan-accept`). Per-feature conditions + rationale: ADR-007 (kit repo) / `native-feature-usage.md` (install targets — read before using one).

### 6.8 Director Mode Protocol

Active only when `directorMode` is enabled (→ `/hk-director`). How-to + examples: `director-mode.md`; rationale: ADR-011. Builds on §6.6 — director mode raises delegation aggressiveness, not on/off.

1. **Intent handshake** before dispatch.
2. **Scoped brief**: target files, expected behaviour, test command, commit format, artifact commit scope — never full history.
3. **Distilled contract**: commit SHA + test status + decisions only; full transcript return is a VIOLATION.
4. **Verification by action**: test re-run + live smoke + contract review; re-ingesting the worker's full transcript is PROHIBITED (→ ADR-010 ④).
5. **Gates stay with director**: Plan Accept, Ship, §5/§9 notification gates never delegated (→ ADR-008).
6. **No over-dispatch**: respect §6.7; single short commands inline. Strict Loop execution delegation → §6.1 Director Mode delegation.

## 7. Deviation & Hard Stop

The Agent MUST immediately **STOP** execution and request re-alignment if:
- A new file outside the Plan scope is required.
- A task cannot be completed as planned.
- A direct commit to `main` is about to occur (→ constitution §10.1).
- A hook blocks a tool call (the stderr message is authoritative).
- An unplanned decision is required (e.g., task decomposition, implementation strategy A/B, unexpected edge case handling).

When stopping for a decision, the Agent MUST follow §8.5 **Choice Presentation Protocol** — every set of options presented to the User MUST include a [Recommendation] line.

## 8. Communication Rules

- Be concise and structured (use bullet points).
- Never assume approval.
- Explicitly state when you are waiting for User input.
- All chat-facing communication is in Korean.

### 8.1 File Path Format

All paths in Agent output MUST be relative to `$HARNESS_ROOT` (e.g. `specs/spec-x-foo/spec.md`, never absolute like `/Users/alice/...`). Applies to spec/plan/task refs, `sdd`/`doctor.sh` output, and inline mentions. When listing multiple spec artifacts, put each full relative path on its own line (not indented filenames under a directory heading) so they stay clickable in Claude Code.

### 8.2 Emoji Usage

Use the following emoji conventions in `sdd` and `doctor.sh` CLI output:

| Situation | Emoji |
|---|---|
| Success / pass | `✓` |
| Warning (non-blocking) | `⚠` |
| Failure / error | `✗` |
| In progress / syncing | `🔄` |
| Next step / action | `→` |
| Ship / push | `🚀` |
| Review / inspect | `🔍` |

Avoid decorative emoji in plain text prose. Emoji in bash output MUST be consistent with the table above.

### 8.3 Table vs List

- Use a markdown **table** when presenting 3 or more items of the same type (hook statuses, file lists, comparison options).
- Use a **list** (`-` or `1.`) for 2 or fewer items, or when order or hierarchy matters.
- In bash output, use `printf "  %-38s  %s\n"` column layout for aligned key-value pairs.

### 8.4 AskUserQuestion Tool Preference

At key decision points (Work Mode → §3, Plan Accept vs Critique → constitution §5.2, PR confirmation → constitution §5.7, Idea Capture Gate → constitution §5.5) the Agent SHOULD use `AskUserQuestion` instead of plain text — keep options 2–4, trade-offs in the description. Text formats (`1)/2)`, `[Y/n]`) remain the authoritative fallback when AUQ isn't rendered or a yes/no suffices. Gated by `uxMode` in `installed.json`: `interactive` (default) → use; `text` → skip; absent → interactive. Change via `sdd config ux-mode [interactive|text|toggle]` or `/hk-ask-mode`.

> 본 fork 운영(dogfood)에서는 CLAUDE.fragment 정책상 AUQ 를 사용하지 않고 모든 게이트를 텍스트로 처리한다 — 위 SHOULD 는 일반 install 대상 기준이며 fragment 가 override 한다.

### 8.5 Choice Presentation Protocol (Mandatory)

Whenever the Agent presents 2+ options and requests a decision — **anywhere in the workflow** (Alignment §3, Hard Stop §4.4, mid-loop task decomposition, impl strategy A/B/C, edge-case handling, Phase Ship Go/No-Go) — the output MUST include a **[Recommendation]** line. No exceptions.

**Required format**:

```
[Intent / Context] <what decision + why, 1-2 lines>
[Options] 1. <A> 2. <B> 3. <C>  (3rd only if applicable)
[Recommendation] <option #> — <reason: prior pattern / risk / constraint>
[Decision Request] <one explicit question>
```

**Why + self-check**: the User often decides on mobile (Telegram/Discord) where long options are slow — a justified [Recommendation] enables a fast call; "missing recommendation" is a recurring failure. Before sending, verify: (1) 2+ options → [Recommendation] required; (2) reason is concrete (pattern/risk/constraint); (3) one unambiguous question. Revise if any fails.

**Exception**: binary Yes/No with a stated default needs no [Recommendation] (e.g. "Plan 을 수락하시겠습니까? [Y/n]").

## 9. Research Spec Protocol

### 9.1 Definition of Done for Research
Unlike implementation specs, Research Specs are considered Done when:
1. **Trade-off Analysis**: At least two options are compared with quantitative or qualitative reasoning.
2. **Prototype**: A proven POC (script or commit) exists if applicable.
3. **Recommendation**: A clear "Go / No-Go" decision is documented.

### 9.2 Deliverables
- **Research Report**: `specs/spec-{N}-{seq}-{slug}/report.md` (replaces `spec.md` for research-only specs)
- **POC Code**: under `scripts/research/` or referenced commits.

## 10. RCA Protocol

When the same failure pattern is observed **two or more times** in operation, the Agent MUST record it as a Root Cause Analysis. RCA bootstrap requires no dedicated slash command — the Agent reads the template directly and proposes a draft for user review.

- **Trigger**: Repeated failure pattern (≥ 2 occurrences) — discoveries surfaced in `walkthrough.md` or user reports.
- **Location**: `docs/rca/RCA-{NNN}-{slug}.md` (NNN = max existing + 1, 3-digit zero-pad).
- **Template**: `.harness-kit/agent/templates/rca.md` — 5 sections (Symptom / Reproduction / Root Cause / Invariant Violated / Prevention).
- **Vocabulary**: frontmatter `type: failure-pattern` (constitution §6.4 closure).
- **Authoring**: Agent drafts the 5 sections from session context; user confirms before commit. Commit format: `docs(rca-{NNN}): <한 줄 요약>`.
- **No automatic diagnosis**: RCA is a human-curated learning record, not an autogenerated report.

## 11. Planning Economy & Inter-Spec Re-Validation

SDD ceremony has a fixed token + time cost. When the work itself is smaller than the ceremony, ROI is negative. Phase plans drift as earlier specs change assumptions for later specs. This section governs both concerns.

### 11.1 SDD Ceremony Cost (Awareness)

Full SDD ceremony (spec+plan+task + Plan Accept + walkthrough+pr_description + PR + review) costs ~6,000–8,000 tokens + review time regardless of work size. Before invoking SDD, the Agent MUST estimate scope and recommend the work mode — do not default to SDD for trivial work.

### 11.2 Scope Economy Thresholds

| Scope | Mode | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 task, single file, reversible | **FF** (requires explicit User approval per constitution §2.3) | typo, single-line guidance, manifest sync |
| 3–5 task, single area | **spec-x** (no phase) **OR** bundle / phase FF (inside an active phase) | minor refactor, small fix bundle |
| 6+ task, cross-file invariant, integration test required | **spec** (in phase) or spec-x | new feature, architectural change |

The Agent MUST state the recommended mode (with one-line reasoning) at the start of every alignment turn that involves new work. The User decides.

### 11.3 Inter-Spec Re-Validation (in Phase)

`backlog/phase-NN.md`'s spec table is a **draft**, NOT a contract. At the start of each subsequent spec inside a phase, the Agent MUST:

1. Read the previous merged spec's `walkthrough.md` (Carry-over Items / Findings sections).
2. Inspect the previous spec's `git diff --stat` (actual change scope).
3. Review **all remaining specs in the phase**, not just the next one.
4. For each remaining spec, assess:
   - **Direction validity** — did the previous spec invalidate the assumptions?
   - **Scope size** — has the actual scope shrunk or grown?
   - **Bundle candidacy** — is another small remaining spec in the same area?
   - **FF demotion candidacy** — is the scope now 1–2 commits?

The Agent reports the assessment to the User before continuing with the next spec.

### 11.4 In-Phase Work Sizing & Re-Adjustment

**Size each item up front — phase-FF is a first-class choice, not only a fallback.** Starting any item in an active Phase, the Agent sizes it: substantial/uncertain → full **Spec**; small/clear/reversible (1–2 commits) → **phase-FF** (direct commit to phase branch, no spec artifacts/re-approval → constitution §3.1, ADR-009). Don't default to "every item is a Spec," nor bundle small items into a Spec just to avoid phase-FF.

Re-adjustment (when an already-planned spec's assumptions shift mid-phase, → §11.3) prefers **bundle** or **phase-FF** over spec-x demotion (preserves thematic cohesion + saves ceremony):

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Direction invalidated, no longer needed | **Drop** spec (remove from `phase.md` table) |
| Direction valid, scope small, another small remaining spec exists | **Bundle** — combine into one spec (the "잡탕 cleanup" pattern, e.g., spec-17-04) |
| Direction valid, scope 1–2 commits, no bundle target | **phase-FF** — commit directly to the phase branch without spec artifacts |
| Direction valid, scope appropriate | **Proceed as planned** |

spec-x demotion is reserved for *leftover work after a phase has ended*, not for in-phase reshaping.

### 11.5 Tool Support

`sdd spec new <slug>` (when invoked inside an active phase with a prior merged spec) outputs a pre-flight summary:
- Previous spec's walkthrough carry-over / findings (section headers).
- Previous spec's `git diff --stat` summary.
- Remaining spec count from `phase.md`.
- One-line re-validation prompt.

This is an **attention prompt, not a gate**. The Agent reads the output and applies §11.3 / §11.4 before continuing. If reshaping is needed, the Agent cancels the `sdd spec new` invocation and adjusts `phase.md` / `queue.md` first.
